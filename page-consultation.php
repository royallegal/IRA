            <h2>Hello Fellow Real Estate Investor,</h2>
            <h3>You are probably a forward thinking investor looking to protect your real estate investments. </h3>

            <p>
            Let me first introduce the enemy in your story. Real estate investors like yourself are incredibly likely to be sued. <b> In fact, according to the nationwide statistics for civil litigation, as a real estate investor, you have a 97% chance of being sued during your lifetime</b>. It’s virtually guaranteed. The ultra rich know this and use sophisticated means to securely protect their real estate investment assets. I would like to let you in on tips only a few lawyers in the country like myself know about. Most lawyers have never even heard of these types of legal strategies. I’m sharing with you the most powerful tools I use as a real estate investor that you can use as well. Keep reading and find out how to use the law to your maximum legal advantage. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before visiting this page, in the back of your mind you may have been questioning if you are really doing your best to secure your wealth. <b>Have you put your lifelong dreams at risk and is the important task of securing your wealth really complete right now?</b> For most, the task is unfinished.
            </p>

                <p>
                Over the years, I’ve discovered most real estate investors are grossly unaware of how financially vulnerable and exposed they are. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Many investors believe a simple LLC structure or a little property insurance will save them if they ever get sued. <b>But the bigger problem is many don’t believe they will ever be sued which is statistically inaccurate as referenced above.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                Look - it’s not your fault that you may have been given misinformation in your journey to eventually become a ‘titan level’ real estate investor. <b>The question is what action are you going to take now so can protect your wealth and your dreams from the looming threat of a lawsuit.</b> I would like to earn the opportunity to help you move from financially exposed to financially secured (just like the mega-rich investors).
                </p>
                <p>
                What I have learned in my own journey to protect over 1000 real estate clients is how most of what you may have researched online is wrong (or at best incomplete).
                </p>
                <p>
                The super wealthy and mega rich real estate investors sleep well at night because they are doing things most common real estate investors are not. 
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Do you want to know how the mega rich are protecting their real estate wealth?</b> If so, I encourage you to keep reading.

            <h2> Now, picture yourself five years from now?</h2>

            <p>How many houses and apartments do you own? What has all of that hard work been able to provide you? With hard work I’ve seen thousands of investors build their dreams. Most people make the mistake of undershooting what they are capable of. I say aim for the heavens and if you fail at least you’ll be among the stars. We live in an amazing place and time. In all of recorded history, there has never been as much wealth and opportunity as we enjoy today — you can really dream big and achieve high levels of success over the arc of your real estate investing career! </p>

            <h3>But, with great abundance can bring unwanted attention. </h3>

            <p>
                There are people who see your wealth and view you as a target. If you own any real estate investment property that can be connected to you through local and state records, it's almost like holding up a big orange sign that says, “PLEASE SUE ME.” Think about it this way. If you could make it so that nobody knew what you owned, would you feel more comfortable?

                        <h3>Sophisticated investors separate assets from operations</h3>
                        <p>
                            Here is a free and valuable piece of legal advice. If your operations are not separated from your properties, you are highly exposed in the event of a lawsuit.
                        </p>

            <p>
                Major lawsuits may only happen a couple times during an investors life, but when they do happen they are a level of pain most people never know. <b>Being threatened with a lawsuit ranks in the top 3 worst things that can happen to you along with divorce and bankruptcy.</b> Imagine, you literally go from one day when everything is fine to the next day when suddenly you and everything you own is under attack. Don’t take my word for it. Ask any of your friends who have been in a major lawsuit and how it affected their peace of mind, their business, their family, and you might even want to ask (if you’re brave enough) how much being unprotected cost them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who has been involved in a major lawsuit approaches protecting their wealth completely differently than they did before the lawsuit. After someone has been through it and having their livelihood put at risk, they don’t play around. Being protected means taking control of your future — no matter if the worst happens, you are going to be OK. <b>You don’t have to wait to have life smack you around first before you make the right decision. </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally know an investor who thought having insurance was enough to protect him. Unfortunately, he got into a car accident and it permanently injured a number of people. The damages exceeded the limits of liability of his policy, and they sued him personally. Know what they got? All of his real estate, valued at over $3,000,000, because he had it all in his personal name. 
            </p>

            <h2>So, Is Your Real Estate Wealth Truly Safe?</h2>

            <p>
                Like thousands of other real estate investors across this great nation of ours, you are building your real estate portfolio piece by piece, making every move with tremendous focus and care. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Having the great fortune to work with over 1000 real estate clients, I consult with how the law favors the proactive and can bring the reactive and unprepared to their knees. <b>The moment your first lawsuit is filed against you, the clock has already run out and it is too late.</b> You’re stuck,the door to protecting your real estate investment wealth has been shut closed, and the outcome is often financially destructive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have watched from the front row as honest, hardworking people like you were devastated by minor accounting technicalities and sneaky legal loopholes. There are professional legal hitman hired solely for this purpose, and they are called litigation attorneys. I’m sure you’ve seen the news on multi-million dollar judgment for spilled hot coffee or other minor injuries getting huge payouts. That is the hitman at work. The fact is, litigation attorneys use any means possible to get rich quick and they only care about how they can get to your money. You’re just another payday to them. Courts don’t care that you’re an honest person. At the end of the day, it’s a shark sitting across the table threatening to take everything you own unless you pay up BIG. 
            </p>
            <h3>And, here is the BIGGER problem.</h3> 
            <p>
                Most real estate investors are grossly unaware of their risk and how vulnerable they are because of their current legal structure, or lack thereof. There is so much misinformation out there, so I totally understand why you may be confused and looking for the best way to secure what you have worked years to nurture.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can now benefit from the exact same protective legal structures used by the elite investors available in an affordable asset protection package.

            <b>Many real estate investors incorrectly think their insurance policy will protect them from a lawsuit.</b> Insurance policies only protect against one kind of lawsuit which is called “negligence” (the legal term for an “accident”). Insurance does not protect if you are sued for ANY other reason including “gross negligence” (e.g. an accident the insurance company deems you should have prevented), “breach of contract” (e.g. any deal that goes sideways), “fraud” (e.g. a simple misunderstanding communicated through an email), and many more!

            Now be honest with me for a moment. I bet you think you’d do well in court. Like my clients, you’re probably a good person, so naturally you’d believe that, but have you maintained perfect records? Have you upheld every letter of the law? Do you have automatic alerts sent to you when the law changes? You can see where I am going — it’s not about who is honest, it is about these legal technicalities. Asset protection is complex, but we make it simple for all of our real estate investment clients looking to protect their wealth and their dreams.

        <h2>A Simple Next Step Towards Better Life Long Returns & Peace of Mind</h2>
<p>
    Most investors don't know that owning all their property in their own name or a single LLC still leaves them exposed. In either case, a lawsuit involving one of the assets means that they can come after every other asset. What you need to do as an investor is isolate each asset from yourself and from every other asset.
</p>
<p>
    The system I use for my over 1000 real estate investor clients is the same one that I use for myself to hold property in over 10 different states. To date, no sharky plaintiff attorney has had success attacking the system we use.
</p>

    We have a simple 7-step process that will guide you towards being protected just like the ultra rich - all at a reasonable packaged rate.

<p>
Shooting straight, my system doesn’t work for everyone, so consider investing 2-3 minutes and answering 10 short questions to apply for a consultation. The consultation is just $150 and is payable when we schedule your consultation if you are fit. Plus there is a money back guarantee. Finally, you will learn the secrets of how the ultra rich protect their wealth. 
</p>
<h2>
What is your combined cost of doing nothing?
</h2>
<p>
If you are not adequately protected right now with your real estate properties, you are essentially rolling the dice every day, hoping to avoid a frivolous lawsuit. As stated earlier, according to the nationwide statistics for civil litigation, as a real estate investor you have a 97% chance of being sued during your lifetime.
</p>
<p>
A question I consider you asking yourself is, “Will you financially survive your first lawsuit?” You might. Noot every lawsuit means complete financial ruin but does it make sense to take the risk if the solution is affordable? 
</p>

<h3>
Avoid the trap of trying to save a penny today to risk the whole dollar.
</h3>

<p>
Let me tell you, it’s a long and painful fall when the shocking truth of a lawsuit comes crashing through your roof. I’ve seen a single lawsuit wipe out over $3,000,000 in real estate investments of someone who thought “insurance is enough.” 
</p>

<p>
If you are unprotected, a single legal battle has the likelihood to turn your life upside down, destroying your life savings, relationships and dreams along with it. Our system can’t ensure you’ll never be sued, but if you are sued you can know you have the best legal system to both protect and hide your assets.
